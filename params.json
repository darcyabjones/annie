{"name":"annie","tagline":"ANNotation Information Extractor","body":"This page is under development. Thank you for your patience!\r\n# Introduction\r\n### License\r\nannie is released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n### Purpose\r\nThe purpose of annie is relatively simple. annie takes your input files (blastout, fasta, gff, etc), does the appropriate cross-referencing for you, and spits out a file that contains the appropriate annotations written in a 3-column table format.\r\n### Installation\r\nannie is written in the beautiful language of [Python 2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/) . If you have Python 2 (not 3!) installed on your computer, you can download the zipped source code link at the top of the page and extract it. That's it!\r\n### Citing annie\r\nIf you'd like to flatter us, please cite us as follows:\r\n> Tate, R., Hall, B., DeRego, T., & Geib, S. (2014). annie: the ANNotation Information Extractor (Version 1.0) [Software]. Available from [http://genomeannotation.github.io/Annie](http://genomeannotation.github.io/Annie).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n### Getting Started\r\nFirst, open up your command prompt/terminal traverse your directories until your reach the annie directory (wherever you decided to extract it on your computer). Once there, you will want to run a command in the following form:\r\n\r\n`python annie.py <case> <input_file1> [<input_file2> ...] <output_file>`\r\n\r\nCurrently, Annie works with two cases: ipr and sprot. More information about the inputFile and outputFile fields are outlined below.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get lost and want to know what the valid inputs for annie are just type:\r\n`python annie.py help`\r\nand help will be on the way shortly.\r\n\r\n### ipr\r\nFor ipr, the command has the following form:\r\n\r\n`python annie.py ipr <ipr_input_file> <output_file>`\r\n\r\nSo an example of what an actual command might look like would be:\r\n\r\n`python annie.py ipr my_ipr_file.ipr my_super_secret_output_file.txt`\r\n\r\nThe output file name can be whatever you want it to be, that's your chance to be creative!\r\n\r\nThe output file is a table of annotations. For each row in the ipr file, it contains the mrna id and the dbxref. It also contains the GO and IPR values if they exist. For each row, we create up to 3 annotations where the feature id is the mrna id, and the keys are \"dbxref\", \"IPR\" and \"GO\" with their respective values. Here is a sample input/output pair:\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n\r\n`m.98281\tc95b0824ccd627403aa63f9e474649cc\t7571\tPfam\tPF00041\tFibronectin type III domain\t3729\t3812\t4.7E-14\tT\t04-04-2014\tIPR003961\tFibronectin, type III\tGO:0005515`\t\r\n\r\n`m.98281\tc95b0824ccd627403aa63f9e474649cc\t7571\tPfam\tPF00041\tFibronectin type III domain\t6484\t6567\t1.8E-12\tT\t04-04-2014\tIPR003961\tFibronectin, type III\tGO:0005515\t`\r\n\r\n`m.42655\tde17ff06d901d22dacc3f5c91510f33f\t288\tPfam\tPF12171\tZinc-finger double-stranded RNA-binding\t45\t69\t1.3E-5\tT\t05-04-2014\tIPR022755\tZinc finger, double-stranded RNA binding\t`\t\r\n\r\n`m.82734\tae22a6fcc80b2ac982378f16ac022b3d\t144\tPfam\tPF14846\tDomain of unknown function (DUF4485)\t8\t89\t4.8E-17\tT\t05-04-2014\tIPR027831\tDomain of unknown function DUF4485\t\t`\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n`m.42655\tDbxref\tPFAM:PF12171`\r\n\r\n`m.42655\tInterPro\tIPR022755`\r\n\r\n`m.82734\tDbxref\tPFAM:PF14846`\r\n\r\n`m.82734\tInterPro\tIPR027831`\r\n\r\n`m.98281\tDbxref\tPFAM:PF00041`\r\n\r\n`m.98281\tGO\tGO:0005515`\r\n\r\n`m.98281\tInterPro\tIPR003961`\r\n\r\nA few notes on the sample input/output:\r\n* The GO annotation doesn't appear for every mrna because not every mrna has one.\r\n* Notice that the mrna, dbxref, GO, and IPR values for the first two entries in the input are the same so they result in the same annotations. Knowing that nobody has time for duplicate annotations, annie automatically removes them for you.\r\n\r\nAnnie makes a few assumptions about your input files so if something doesn't work, check to see if your file meets these assumptions:\r\n* values in each row are tab-separated\r\n* the first column is the mrna id\r\n* the 4th and 5th columns correspond to your dbxref\r\n* the 12th column is the IPR column if the 12th column exists\r\n* the 14th column is the GO column if the 14th column exists\r\n\r\n### sprot\r\n# Configuration\r\n### Dbxref Whitelist\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
